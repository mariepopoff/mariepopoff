### Hi there 👋, I'm Marie 👩‍💻

I am a full-stack developer in France.

I work with JavaScript, and gathered most experience in React in the front-end, and Node, Express and MongoDb in the back-end.

Before coding, I was Head of Customer Service in a french start-up of the foodtech industry. I learnt there how to manage fast-paced projects in a challenging environment. I also acquired a sharp sense of detail and a problem solving mindset, that I bring to my projects !

Outside of programming I love cooking 🧑, theater 🎭  and travelling 🌎.
